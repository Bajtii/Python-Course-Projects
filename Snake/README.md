![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/099daf6c-143a-44ac-a852-a9d987f62b6a)

A classic Snake game implemented in Python using the `turtle` graphics module. This game features a modular, object-oriented design with separate classes for the snake, food, and scoreboard.

## 🎮 Features

- Smooth animation using `screen.tracer()` and time-based updates  
- Food randomly appears and increases the snake's length  
- Score tracking with on-screen display  
- Game over detection for:  
  - Collision with walls  
  - Collision with the snake’s own tail  
- Keyboard controls (`Arrow keys`)

## 🎮 Controls

- `Up Arrow` → Move Up  
- `Down Arrow` → Move Down  
- `Left Arrow` → Move Left  
- `Right Arrow` → Move Right

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

- Object-Oriented Programming in Python  
- Collision detection  
- GUI animation with the `turtle` module  
- Modular code organization  
- Event listeners (`onkey`, `listen`)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.  
2. Clone this repo and run the game:

## ✅ Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- No additional libraries required (uses the standard `turtle` module)

## 🧱 Classes Overview

- **Snake**: Handles the snake’s segments, movement, and growth logic  
- **Food**: Creates and refreshes the food at random positions on the screen  
- **Scoreboard**: Tracks and displays the current score and shows the game-over message
