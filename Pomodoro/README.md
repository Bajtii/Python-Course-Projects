# 🍅 Pomodoro Timer App (Tkinter GUI)

A simple and effective **Pomodoro Timer** built with Python and Tkinter. This productivity tool helps you stay focused and work in intervals using the Pomodoro technique: 25 minutes of work followed by short breaks.

> ⏱️ Based on the classic Pomodoro Technique by Francesco Cirillo.

## 📋 Features

- ✅ Work, short break, and long break cycles
- 🔁 Automatic transitions between intervals
- ✔ Visual checkmarks after each completed work session
- 🖥️ Minimal and responsive Tkinter-based GUI
- 🍅 Tomato-themed design for Pomodoro flavor

## 🧠 How It Works

- **Work Session:** Default is 25 minutes (`WORK_MIN`)
- **Short Break:** After each work session, 5-minute break (`SHORT_BREAK_MIN`)
- **Long Break:** After 4 work sessions, a 20-minute break (`LONG_BREAK_MIN`)
- Repeats until reset

> You can adjust the time durations by modifying the constants at the top of the script.
