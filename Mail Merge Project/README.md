# ✉️ Personalized Letter Generator

This Python project reads a list of names and a letter template, then creates individual, personalized letters for each name. It's a simple and effective demonstration of file handling, string manipulation, and automation in Python.

## 📋 Description

The program performs the following steps:

1. Reads names from `invited_names.txt`.
2. Loads a template letter from `starting_letter.txt` (containing a placeholder like `[name]`).
3. Replaces the `[name]` placeholder with each person's actual name.
4. Saves each personalized letter in the `Output/ReadyToSend` directory.
