An interactive Python program using the `turtle` graphics module, allowing users to control a turtle using keyboard inputs. A great example of event-driven programming and basic graphical interface in Python — perfect for beginners!

## 📋 Description

This program opens a graphical window where you can control the turtle with your keyboard:

- `W` – move forward
- `S` – move backward
- `A` – turn left
- `D` – turn right
- `C` – clear the screen and reset position

It uses the `onkey()` method to listen for key presses and reacts in real time.
